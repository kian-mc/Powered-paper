I have no begun construction on this project yet.
I have not ordered any of the parts yet as im still finalizing the prototype design.
I have not yet designed it but there will be a base for all the electronics to go on that will be 3d printed out of ABS so it wont melt in the sun.
The display will be an LED on the plane that will indicate charge, it will start blinking when the battery is less than 10%.
The manual user input will be an rc receiver.
The automatic sensor will be the accelerometers on the PICO to make the plane fly stable, there will be a button you can push on the controller that will enable auto stabilization.
The acuators will be the digital linear servos that control the controll surfaces.
The pico will be programmed to intigrate all these systems.
I see 3 main issues with this:
Budget; i am a little worried about the bufget esspecialy will all the diffrnet parts and the RC controller.
Weight; paper airplains have very little lift, i need to save all the weight i posibly can.
Strenght; with all the weight savings im worried about the structural integrity and the posiblility of a crash or a landing being devistating.
